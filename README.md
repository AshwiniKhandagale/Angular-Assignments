# Angular-Assignments

# Directive:-
 Directives are mainly used when we want a re-usable HTML Component, a re-usable HTML behavior, or any time we interact with the DOM. This is done with the help of a decorator @Directive. There are three types of directive.
     # 1. Component
     # 2. Structural Directive
     # 3. Attribute Directive

# Structural Directive:-
 Structural Directives are the directives that are used to modify the layout by adding or removing the DOM elements. *ngFor, *ngIf, *ngSwitch are the structural directive.

# Attribute Directive:- 
Attribute Directives are responsible for manipulating the appearance and behavior of DOM elements. We can use attribute directives to change the style of DOM elements. These directives are also used to hide or show particular DOM elements conditionally. Angular provides many built-in Attribute Directives like NgStyle, NgClass, etc. We can also create our own custom Attribute Directives for our desired functionality.

# Interpolation:-
Interpolation is a special syntax that Angular converts into property binding. Itâ€™s a convenient alternative to property binding.

# Property Binding:-
  It set an element property to a non-string data value

# Pipe :-
Pipes are an incredibly useful and clean way to transform data in the template in Angular. Their are two types of pipe.
      1. Built In Pipe
      2. Custom Pipe
