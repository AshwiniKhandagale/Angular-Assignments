# Angular-Assignments

# Directive:-
 Directives are mainly used when we want a re-usable HTML Component, a re-usable HTML behavior, or any time we interact with the DOM. This is done with the help of a decorator @Directive. There are three types of directive.
     #1. Component
     #2. Structural Directive
     #3. Attribute Directive

# Structural Directive:-
     Structural Directives are the directives that are used to modify the layout by adding or removing the DOM elements. *ngFor, *ngIf, *ngSwitch are the structural directive.

# Pipe :-
Pipes are an incredibly useful and clean way to transform data in the template in Angular. Their are two types of pipe.
      1. Built In Pipe
      2. Custom Pipe
